### Overview
[Techtonica](https://techtonica.org) is a nonprofit that provides free tech training with stipends and job placement to women and non-binary adults with low incomes. 

We discovered that our participants need an app similar to typing practice websites out there, but for Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts. Try the current version of the app [here](https://techtonica.github.io/keyboard-shortcuts-practice/).


This project should train and test users to use the quicker keyboard shortcuts instead of a mouse and the GUI. The app gets more challenging as you progress through the commands.

Our goal for the backend project is to create a persistent app where users 
can sign in, practice with the app, and save their progress. That way, the next time they sign in, they can pick up where they left off rather than starting at the beginning.

### Running the project

1. Clone the project by running `git clone https://github.com/Techtonica/keyboard-shortcuts-practice.git` in your terminal.
2. Run `cd keyboard-shortcuts-practice` to get into the root directory.
3. Run `git pull` to make sure you have the latest changes.
4. Run `git checkout backend` to go to the backend branch. This is the ONLY branch that we will be working in.
5. Run `npm install` to install all the packages.
6. Run `npm start` to start the server. (While developing, you can run `npm run dev` instead which will start up nodemon - nodemon listens for changes in .js, .ejs, and .json files and restarts the server for you.)
7. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or `localhost:3000` in your browser. Your project should be running at this point.
8. You should be good to go at this point!
9. See your pull requests here: https://github.com/Techtonica/keyboard-shortcuts-practice/pulls
